This Repo contains my record of learning Deep Learning. Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning which tries to train a machine model as of human brain. 
Not exactly same but the underlying smallest unit of Deep Learning which is a Perceptron is inspired from human nerves. Point to note is Perceptron is inspired from our nuerons but not same, actually till now 
we don't know how exactly nuerons works from inside.
